            On February 22, 2019, the Wall Street journal reported
            that Flo Health's Period & Ovulation tracker told Facebook when its users were having their periods or
            expressing an intent to get pregnant. Flo Health's privacy policy specifically said it wasn’t doing this.
            Flo Health claimed the data was depersonalized. The Wall Street Journal tested that and found that one of
            the things being
            shared was an advertising identifier that could be matched to a device or profile. It was designed to work
            that way.

            <p>In 2017, Facebook upped the ante and did an emotional study by analyzing the usage patterns of 6.4
                million
                Australian youth on their platform, including 1.9 million highschool kids as young as 14 to figure out
                when
                they were feeling the most worthless, in order to target them with higher value ads.

                On June 18, 2016, Facebook VP Andrew Bosworth circulated this internal memo:

                “We connect people. That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact
                importing practices… That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs someone alive by exposing
                someone to bullies… Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools”

                They knew what they were doing, they saw getting someone killed as the. Price of doing business. It was
                designed to work that way.
