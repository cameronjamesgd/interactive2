            In 2014, Facebook ran an experiment on over 600,000 human beings using their service. Facebook filled those
            users’ newsfeed with overwhelmingly negative news to see if it had effect on those users’ mental health.
            Facebook ran a human mental health experiment on its own users without their consent. Obviously anyone with
            mental health issues had no opportunity to opt out. Neither did anyone else. </p>

            <p>On February 22, 2019, the Wall Street journal reported
                that Flo Health's Period & Ovulation tracker told Facebook when its users were having their periods or
                expressing an intent to get pregnant. Flo Health's privacy policy specifically said it wasn’t doing
                this.
                Flo Health claimed the data was depersonalized. The Wall Street Journal tested that and found that one
                of
                the things being shared was an advertising identifier that could be matched to a device or profile. It
                was
                designed to work that way.</p>

                Democratic congresswoman Anna. Eshoo asked him, Are you willing to change your business model to protect
                users’ privacy?” His reply: “Congresswoman, I don’t know what that means. I believe him.</p>
