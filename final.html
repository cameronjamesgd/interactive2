        <h1>Larry Sultan</h1>
        <p class="desc">This funky micro site is an exploration of the realationship between type and color. These nifty
            typefaces come form OH NO TYPE CO, An Oakland based type foundry started by Califronia College of the Arts
            alumni James Edminson. I created this far-out experience in part
            to encourage explorations in color, but mainly to satisfy my main man will. During the process of this
            project I furthered my understanding of the relationship between java and svg elements. One of the most
            interesting elements of this this was the ease of color exploration in short amounts of time with simple
            movments. </p>
